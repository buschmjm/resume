        <h4 class="section-title">SUMMARY</h4>
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>I work across systems, cloud platforms, and internal tools to make businesses run smoother. I don’t just fix things when they break. I build better ways to do the work. My background covers automation, infrastructure, app development, and integrations across multiple platforms. I stay focused on what’s useful to the team, and I build with long term reliability in mind. I’m not afraid to take ownership, and I know how to lead technical projects that make a real difference.</p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="section-title">ABOUT ME - PROFESSIONAL</h4>
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>I lead technical projects from start to finish. That includes building internal tools, automating workflows, handling system integrations, and managing infrastructure across cloud and on prem. I’ve been the go to person for our leadership team when something needs to change or improve. I work with every department and make sure the systems I build actually match how people work, day to day. My background covers a wide range of tools and platforms, and I’m always learning new ones to stay ahead of what’s needed.</p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="section-title">ABOUT ME - PERSONAL</h4>
        <div class="about-section">
          <p>I’m a husband and a dad before anything else. Most of my free time is spent with my family — exploring outside, camping, or just being together. I like hands-on projects and finding ways to make things work better. That usually means tinkering with 3D printing, automating something around the house, or working on a random side project just to see if I can. I’m always curious, always building, and always looking for ways to make life a little easier.</p>
